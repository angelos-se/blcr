The html subdirectory contains versions of the documentation on the BLCR
website (http://ftg.lbl.gov/checkpoint) which were current at the time
this BLCR distribution was packaged:

html/BLCR_Admin_Guide.html      Installation and configuration information
html/BLCR_Users_Guide.html      General Users' Guide
html/FAQ.html                   Frequently Asked Questions with answers

You may find more up-to-date versions on the web, but should take care
that the information obtained from the website may not pertain to this
specific BLCR distribution.

You may also wish to consult the following BLCR man pages for information
on using the BLCR utilities:
     cr_checkpoint    Checkpoint a running process (or group of processes)
     cr_restart       Restart processes from a checkpoint
     cr_run           Run a program with BLCR support added via LD_PRELOAD

For API documentation for libcr, you must currently rely on the comments
in libcr.h.  More formal/useful documentation is planned when the API is
more complete.
