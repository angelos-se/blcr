<h1>Berkeley Lab Checkpoint/Restart (BLCR) Administrator's Guide</h1>
This guide describes how to install, configure, and maintain Berkeley
Lab Checkpoint/Restart (BLCR) for Linux.  For usage instructions
please see the companion <a href="BLCR_Users_Guide.html">BLCR User's Guide</a>.
<h2>1. System Requirements</h2>
BLCR consists of two kernel modules, some user-level libraries, and
several
command-line executables. <em>No kernel patching is required.</em>
<p>BLCR has been engineered to work with a wide range of Linux kernels:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many major vendor distributions of Linux. Those tested
historically have included SuSE,
RHEL (and clones such as CentOS and Scientific Linux), Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu
(and this list is NOT exhaustive).</li>
  <li>Many "vanilla" Linux 2.6.x and 3.x.y kernels (from <a
 href="http://www.kernel.org/">kernel.org</a>) have also been tested
with many glibc versions (2.2 and up).<br>
We believe vanilla versions 2.6.0 through 3.16.2 all work.
  <li>BLCR uses a set of autoconf-based feature tests to probe the
kernels it builds against. It is thus likely that a custom kernel based
on one of the above kernel sources will work with BLCR, provided that
patches applied to the kernel don't invalidate assumptions BLCR has
made. </li>
</ul>
BLCR uses assembly code to save some program state (most notably the
CPU
registers). This means that the BLCR kernel modules are not portable
across CPU
architectures "out of the box".
BLCR has long supported the x86 and x86_64 architectures.&nbsp;
The 0.6.0 release was the first to include <em>experimental</em>
support for PowerPC64 and for ARM, while the 0.7.0 release added
<em>experimental</em> support for 32-bit PowerPC.&nbsp;
<b>Currently x86 and x86_64 systems are the most fully tested with BLCR,
with the other architectures tested heavily only at release time</b>.

Porting BLCR to a different CPU is not a large software effort <b>if</b>
one has sufficient Linux kernel experience and knowledge of the target
CPU's ABI and instructions.&nbsp;
Please contact us if you are interested in contributing a port.  We are
especially interested in somebody with the time and equipment to
complete the unfinished port to SPARC64.

<h2>2. Installing/Configuring BLCR</h2>
To build checkpoint/restart, you need the following files:
<ul>
  <li> The source code for the <i>configured</i>
kernel you are building against. </li>
  <li> <tt>linux/version.h</tt> (a generated file from the kernel
sources). </li>
  <li> either the <tt>System.map</tt> or the <tt>vmlinux</tt> file
for the kernel you are building against. </li>
  <li> A copy of the BLCR source (blcr-X.Y.Z.tar.gz: see <a
 href="http://ftg.lbl.gov/checkpoint" target="_top">http://ftg.lbl.gov/checkpoint</a>
for a link to the latest version). </li>
</ul>
If you run into trouble when following the instructions below, make
sure to
check
both our <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a> (especially the "Build/Install
Questions"
section), and our bug database, located at <a
 href="http://mantis.lbl.gov/bugzilla/">http://mantis.lbl.gov/bugzilla/</a>.
Your install problem may have already been solved!
<h3>2.1 Configuring BLCR</h3>
<p>BLCR builds and installs much like any other autotools-based
distribution: <pre>
    % tar zxf blcr-&lt;VERSION&gt;.tar.gz
    % cd blcr-&lt;VERSION&gt;
    % mkdir builddir
    % cd builddir
    % ../configure [ options ]
    % make
    % make install
</pre>
Depending on which kernel you are building against, and where you wish
to put
the BLCR libraries, there are a number of options to <tt>configure</tt>
that you
need to consider.  The most common of these are described in the
paragraphs that follow.
<p>We strongly recommend that you configure and build BLCR in a directory
other than the one containing the BLCR source code (use of some options
to <tt>configure</tt> actually require this).  In the example above the
build is conducted in a subdirectory, named '<tt>builddir</tt>', of the
source directory.  Any writable location is fine, but you will
need to invoke <tt>configure</tt> by the correct path in place of
'<tt>../configure</tt>' used in the example.
<p>If you run into issues building BLCR on your system, check the
<a href="#platform">Platform-specific notes</a>
section of this document and the <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a>.
<h4> Choosing an installation directory </h4>
By default BLCR will install into <tt>/usr/local</tt>. To choose a
different
directory tree to install into, pass the '<tt>--prefix</tt>' flag to
<tt>configure</tt>:
<ul>
  <li> <strong>--prefix</strong>=[the directory you wish to install
into] </li>
</ul>
However, be aware that using a location other than <code>/usr/local</code>
or <code>/usr</code> may require additions to
the <code>PATH</code>, <code>MANPATH</code> and <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
environment variables of users (more details below).<br>
<h4>Building against a kernel other than the one that's running</h4>
<p>By default, BLCR builds against the kernel that is running on the
system at configure time, and looks in a number of standard locations
for the required files that correspond to it.
However, if you're building for a kernel <em>other</em> than the
kernel that is running at the time of the build, then
you'll need to pass <tt>configure</tt> <b>one</b> of the following two options:
<ul>
  <li> <strong>--with-linux</strong>=[kernel version such as 2.6.24.3-34.fc8-i686]</li>
  <li> <strong>--with-linux</strong>=[full path to the kernel build directory]</li>
</ul>
If no <strong>--with-linux</strong> is passed, the default is equivalent to
<strong>--with-linux</strong>=<tt>`uname -r`</tt>.
<h4>Building with files in locations unknown to BLCR</h4>
<p>In most standard installations, either the default settings or a
manual <strong>--with-linux</strong> option should be enough to
find all the required files.  However, in some cases <tt>configure</tt> will
need additional help.  For instance, if the sources are not in a well known
directory, the <strong>--with-linux-src</strong>=[full path] option can be
used to tell configure where they are.  Similarly, BLCR needs either
the <tt>System.map</tt> or <tt>vmlinux</tt> files.  So if neither are found
in well known locations, you'll need to pass <tt>configure</tt> <b>one</b> of
the following two options:
<ul>
  <li> <strong>--with-system-map</strong>=[full path to the System.map file]</li>
  <li> <strong>--with-vmlinux</strong>=[full path to the kernel executable]</li>
</ul>
Note that the <tt>vmlinuz</tt> file (note the final character 'z') cannot
be used as a replacement for <tt>System.map</tt> or <tt>vmlinux</tt>.
<h4>Separate compilers for user-space and kernel</h4>
<p>Historically, the Linux kernel sources have not always been kept current
as gcc versions have advanced.  As a result, there have been Linux distributions
that have shipped two gcc versions: a current one for user-space code and
an older one for compiling the kernel and kernel modules.
There are also distributions that have a 64-bit kernel, but build (nearly)
all of user-space as 32-bit.  In that case, there might be a single gcc
version installed with a default of building 32-bit objects, which therefore
won't work as-is to compile the kernel modules.
<p>In either of these cases it may be required to have BLCR build its user-space
and kernel module portions with different compilers (or the same compiler
with different flags).  Just as most other configure-based packages, BLCR
can be configured to use a specific C compiler by setting the "CC" variable
at configure time.  In addition, BLCR's configure honors a "KCC" variable
to specify the C compiler to use for the kernel modules.
For our first motivating example (a distribution with a distinct "kgcc"),
you could use the following:
<pre>    % configure [ options ] KCC=kgcc<br></pre>
For our second motivating example (64-bit kernel with 32-bit user-space
and gcc defaulting to 32-bit objects), you could use the following:
<pre>    % configure [ options ] KCC='gcc -m64'<br></pre>
<p>If not set explicitly, KCC defaults to the value configure finds
for CC.
<h4>Building 32-bit application support on a 64-bit platform</h4>
<p>BLCR's build logic is capable of building both 64-bit and 32-bit
libraries at the same time on most 64-bit platforms it supports.&nbsp;
However, because this feature does not work well with
certain setups, it is disabled by default.&nbsp; To enable it you'll
want to pass configure the following option:<br>
<ul>
  <li><strong>--enable-multilib</strong></li>
</ul>
This option assumes "CC" generates 64-bit objects, and may instruct you
to try again with the addition of an option like <tt>CC='gcc -m64'</tt>
if that is not the case.
<p>If configuration fails with this option specified, you can still
configure without it to get only 64-bit application support.
<p>BLCR does not currently support any mechanism to build
32-bit utilities and 64-bit libraries at the same time.  If you want
64-bit libraries, you currently have to settle for 64-bit utilities
as well.
<h4>Building static libraries (optional)</h4>
<p>By default, BLCR does not build static versions of its libraries.  If
you want/need static libraries, you may enable the with:<br>
<ul>
  <li><strong>--enable-static</strong></li>
</ul>
However, do not pass <strong>--disable-shared</strong> unless you
are certain you know what you are doing.  Without the dynamic shared
libraries, the <tt>cr_run</tt> utility will not function.
<h4>Building static executables (discouraged)</h4>
<p>BLCR's utilities (<tt>cr_run</tt>, <tt>cr_checkpoint</tt> and
<tt>cr_restart</tt>) are normally build with the default linker flags.
This will, for most installations, result in dynamically linked
executables.  You may force BLCR to build statically linked utilities
by passing <tt>configure</tt> the following two options:
<ul>
  <li><strong>--enable-static --enable-all-static</strong></li>
</ul>
You might also get statically linked BLCR utilities by default if your
system has no dynamic libraries installed.
<p>If you configure with <strong>--enable-all-static</strong> (or
have no dynamic libraries on your system), you should be aware that
you may unknowingly be linking in the LinuxThreads implementation of
pthreads, <strong>which BLCR does not support</strong>.  This happens
because currently many Linux distributions install the LinuxThreads
static libraries in the default library search path, and the
BLCR-supported NPTL libraries are installed elsewhere.  If this
happens to you, then configure
will fail.  The solution
is to provide the proper "CPPFLAGS" and "LDFLAGS" when you configure
BLCR.  Appending something like the following to the <tt>configure</tt>
command line may work:
<ul>
  <li><strong>CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/include/nptl' 
	LDFLAGS='-L/usr/lib/nptl -L/usr/lib64/nptl'</strong></li>
</ul>
Though you could/should leave out one of the two "LDFLAGS" options
if not performing a <tt>--enable-multilib</tt> build.
<h4>Building an installable BLCR testsuite (optional)</h4>
If you pass <tt>configure</tt> the following option:
<ul>
  <li><strong>--enable-testsuite</strong></li>
</ul>
then BLCR's tests will not only be built for testing via "<tt>make check</tt>",
but will also be installed via "<tt>make install</tt>".  The testsuite
is installed in <tt><i>PREFIX</i>/libexec/blcr-testsuite</tt>, and can be
executed by running <tt>RUN_ME</tt> in that directory (once the environment
variables are setup correctly).
<h3>2.2 Compiling BLCR</h3>
Just type 'make':
<pre>    % make<br></pre>
If you get errors, first check the FAQ and then contact us for help.
<h3>2.3 Testing your build (optional, but recommended)</h3>
As with many autotools-based packages, BLCR includes a '<code>check</code>'
make target.&nbsp; However, it cannot run the tests until the kernel
modules are loaded (and will tell you so if you forget).&nbsp; Since
the not-yet-installed kernel modules are located throughout the BLCR
build
directory, an '<code>insmod</code>' make target is provided to automate
this task.&nbsp; If
you are not running as root, "<code>make insmod</code>" will try to use
the '<code>sudo</code>' utility to perform the insmod operations as
root.&nbsp; However, it is not necessary (or recommended) to run the
tests themselves as
root.&nbsp; So, we recommend run the following as a non-root user if '<code>sudo</code>'
is installed and configured to allow your user:<br>
<pre>    % make insmod check<br></pre>
Which may prompt for a password, depending on how '<code>sudo</code>'
is configured.&nbsp; If the 'sudo' utility is not installed (or not
configured for your user), the following steps are equivalent:<pre>
    % su
    Password:[type root password here]
    # make insmod
    # exit
    % make check
</pre>
If the modules fail to load, then your kernel may not be supported and
you'll need to report this as a bug to the BLCR team, after first
checking the bug database to ensure the problem isn't already known (or
even fixed).&nbsp; Similarly, if one or more tests fail, we'll want to
know that too.&nbsp; However, if the only failures are one or two tests
that say "restart/timeout" then you should first try increasing the
timeout as follows (assuming the kernel modules have already been
loaded):<br>
<pre>    % make check CRUT_TIMEOUT=120<br></pre>
The '<code>CRUT_TIMEOUT</code>' is a value in seconds, with a default
of 60&nbsp; (CRUT is an acronym for Checkpoint/Restart Unit Test).<br>
<p>
Tests marked 'SKIP' are neither a 'PASS', nor a 'FAIL' - instead they
indicate a test that was not actually run.
So don't be alarmed if you see one or more tests marked 'SKIP'.
This happens when a given test is not applicable to your system (for
instance the <tt>hugetlbfs</tt> test is skipped when no writable mountpoint
for hugetlbfs is found).
<p>Note that BLCR's testsuite intentionally tries to do "bad" things
and many lines of output are expected in the system logs as a result.
Do not be alarmed by them, but be prepared to provide them with any
failures you report to us.
<p><strong>We do not advise continuing to
install BLCR if any tests 'FAIL'</strong> (other than timeouts correctable
by raising <code>CRUT_TIMEOUT</code> sufficiently).</p>
<h3>2.4 Installing BLCR</h3>
<p>Use the standard '<tt>install</tt>' make target to install the BLCR
utilities
and libraries, and to place the kernel modules in the standard location
for your
kernel:
<pre>    % make install<br></pre>
or, if you prefer stripped binaries:
<pre>    % make install-strip<br></pre>
<h3>2.5 Loading the Kernel Modules</h3>
Before you can checkpoint/restart applications, the kernel modules need
to be
loaded into your kernel. The kernel modules are placed into a
subdirectory of the <tt>lib/blcr</tt>
(or <code>lib64/blcr</code>) branch of the installation directory. In
this example, we'll assume the
installation
prefix was the default <tt>/usr/local</tt> and that your kernel is
version <tt>2.6.12-1.234</tt> for an x86.
Thus, for this example the kernel modules are in the directory
<tt>/usr/local/lib/blcr/2.6.12-1.234/</tt>. There are two kernel
modules
in
this directory which must be loaded (in the correct order) for
BLCR to function.
<p>As <tt>root</tt>, load the kernel modules in this order:
</p><pre>
    # /sbin/insmod /usr/local/lib/blcr/2.6.12-1.234/blcr_imports.ko
    # /sbin/insmod /usr/local/lib/blcr/2.6.12-1.234/blcr.ko
</pre>
<p> You may wish to set up your system to load these modules by default
at boot
time. The exact mechanism for doing so differs between Linux
distributions, and
thus requires an experienced system administrator. However, a template
init
script is provided as <tt>etc/blcr.rc</tt> in the BLCR source
directory.
</p>
<h3>2.6 Updating ld.so.cache</h3>
Nearly all Linux distributions use a caching mechanism for resolving dynamic library
dependencies.  If you have installed BLCR's shared library in a directory that is
cached by the mechanism, then you will need to update this cache.  To do so,
run the <tt>ldconfig</tt> command as <tt>root</tt>; no command-line arguments are needed.
<p>
It should always be safe to run the <tt>ldconfig</tt> command, even if BLCR did not
install its library in a directory managed in the cache.  However, if you wish to
avoid this step when unnecessary, you can know that BLCR's shared library is in a
cached directory if you configured with <tt>--prefix=</tt>
or <tt>--libdir=</tt> options that cause BLCR's shared library (<tt>libcr.so</tt>) to be
installed in:
<ul>
  <li><tt>/lib</tt> or <tt>/usr/lib</tt>
  <li>any directory listed in <tt>/etc/ld.so.conf</tt>
  <li>any directory listed in a file under <tt>/etc/ld.so.conf.d/</tt>
</ul>
Note that if you passed no <tt>--prefix=</tt> or <tt>--libdir=</tt> options to
BLCR's configure script, then you should check <tt>/etc/ld.so.conf</tt>
and <tt>/etc/ld.so.conf.d/</tt> for <tt>/usr/local/lib</tt> (the default location)
to determine if you actually need to run the <tt>ldconfig</tt> command.
<h3>2.7 Configuring Users' environments</h3>
Finally, you may wish to add the appropriate BLCR directories to the
default
<tt>PATH</tt>, <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>, and <tt>MANPATH</tt>
environment variables for your users.
You may either modify the <tt>/etc/profile</tt> and/or <tt>/etc/cshrc</tt>
files, or add new files in the <tt>/etc/profile.d</tt> directory.
Alternatively,
you may provide <a href="http://modules.sourceforge.net/">modules</a>
that
accomplish the same thing. You should replace <i>PREFIX</i> by the
installation
prefix (such as <tt>/usr/local</tt>) in the following examples:
<p>For Bourne-style shells:</p><pre>
    $ PATH=$PATH:<i>PREFIX</i>/bin
    $ MANPATH=$MANPATH:<i>PREFIX</i>/man
    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<i>PREFIX</i>/lib:<i>PREFIX</i>/lib64
    $ export PATH MANPATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>
<p>For csh-style shells:</p><pre>
    % setenv PATH ${PATH}:<i>PREFIX</i>/bin
    % setenv MANPATH ${MANPATH}:<i>PREFIX</i>/man
    % setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:<i>PREFIX</i>/lib:<i>PREFIX</i>/lib64
</pre>
<p>These example assume a "multilib" system with both <tt>/lib</tt> and <tt>/lib64</tt>
directories.  If your system lacks one of these two directories, the corresponding
colon-separated entry may be omitted from the value of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.</p>
<p>
It is worth noting that if the BLCR libraries are installed in a directory
named in <tt>/etc/ld.so.conf</tt> or <tt>/etc/ld.so.conf.d/</tt>, then you
do not need to add it to <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>.  Similarly, you may
find it unnecessary to add to <tt>PATH</tt> and/or <tt>MANPATH</tt> if BLCR
has been installed in a location that is already searched.
</p>
<h3>2.8 Uninstalling BLCR</h3>
If you preserve the BLCR build tree, then there is a standard '<code>uninstall</code>'
make target available to remove the files copied by the '<code>install</code>'
target.<br>
<h2>3. Making RPMs from the BLCR sources</h2>
An alternate way to install BLCR is to build a binary RPM for your
system, which
you can then install. This has certain advantages (such as making
upgrading
easier, especially if you maintain BLCR on multiple systems).
<h3>3.1 Building binary RPMs from the source tarball</h3>
Once you've configured BLCR with any options your system requires, the
simplest method for building RPMs is to just
<pre>    % make rpms<br></pre>
If successful, the new RPM packages will be in the
<tt>rpm/RPMS</tt> subdirectory of the build tree. The resulting
packages will be
for whatever kernel you configured for.
<h3>3.2 Building a binary RPM from source RPMS</h3>
You may also with start from a source RPM (with a <tt>.src.rpm</tt>
suffix)
rather than the <tt>.tar.gz</tt> version of the BLCR distribution.
Source RPMs are
available on our <a href="http://ftg.lbl.gov/checkpoint" target="_top">website</a>.
These source RPMs are configured to build for the <em>running</em>
kernel, with <code>--prefix=/usr</code> and to configure with <code>--enable-multilib</code> on 64-bit
platforms.
Alternatively, the <tt>'make rpms'</tt> step above will create a
source
RPM
in the <tt>rpm/SRPMS</tt> subdirectory of the build tree, valid for
the
<em>configured</em> kernel.
<p>If building as <tt>root</tt>, built RPMs will be placed in a
subdirectory of
<tt>/usr/src/redhat/RPMS</tt>. However, if you are not <tt>root</tt>,
you may
need to see
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-rpm2/">this page
at IBM</a>
for information on configuring an output location before
proceeding.&nbsp; Personally, we prefer
<b>not</b> to build as root.
<p>To build binary RPMs from the source RPM, use
<pre>    % rpmbuild --rebuild blcr-X.Y.Z-N.src.rpm --target ARCH<br></pre>
replacing <tt>blcr-X.Y.Z-N.src.rpm</tt> with the correct filename,
and <tt>ARCH</tt> with a specific target CPU. If you don't know
your target, try "<tt>uname -p</tt>" to determine it.
If you don't specify a <tt>--target</tt>, the default will depend on
the
version of rpmbuild and may be i386 (which will be rejected).
See the documentation for <tt>rpmbuild</tt> for more information on
building
binary RPMs from source RPMs.
<p>If you are on a 64-bit platform and do not wish to build the 32-bit
libraries (or lack the required toolchain), then you can disable
the default <code>--enable-multilib</code> behavior of the source RPM
by adding <tt>--define 'with_multilib 0'</tt> to the <tt>rpmbuild</tt>
command line.
<p>The RPMs should build without error. However, if not building for
the running
kernel, you may see a warning about this. You will see the location of
the binary
RPMs in the last few lines of output from <tt>rpmbuild</tt> - 
something like this:
</p><pre>
    Wrote: /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i686/blcr-0.8.6_b4-1.i686.rpm
    Wrote: /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i686/blcr-libs-0.8.6_b4-1.i686.rpm
    Wrote: /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i686/blcr-devel-0.8.6_b4-1.i686.rpm
    Wrote: /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i686/blcr-modules_2.6.12_1.234-0.8.6_b4-1.i686.rpm
    Wrote: /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i686/blcr-testsuite-0.8.6_b4-1.i686.rpm
</pre>
You should note that the kernel version <tt>2.6.12-1.234</tt> has
become
<tt>2.6.12_1.234</tt> in the name of the <tt>blcr-modules</tt> package
(a change of a hyphen to an underscore).
<p> In most cases, you will want to install the <tt>blcr</tt>, <tt>blcr-libs</tt>
and <tt>blcr-modules</tt> binary RPMS.  The <tt>blcr-devel</tt> is only required on
machines on which you will compiling/linking source code against BLCR's libraries.  So,
for a cluster you may want to install <tt>blcr-devel</tt> only on the front-end node(s).
<p> The <tt>blcr-testsuite</tt> RPM is optional.  You may install and run the testsuite
(<tt>/usr/libexec/blcr-testsuite/RUN_ME</tt>) if you wish to verify correct
operation of BLCR.  You may be asked to do this if you report bugs to us.
<h2><a name="platform">4. Platform-specific notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>PowerPC (32- and 64-bit)<br>
    <ul>
    <li> There is a known problem with signal handling in some PowerPC kernel versions
         2.6.15 and older that can cause restart failures with BLCR.  Therefore,
         for effected kernels one must configure with '<tt>--with-bug2524</tt>' to
         enable a work-around in BLCR (with a very small performance penalty).<br>
         If you are configuring for a kernel 2.6.15 or older on a PowerPC, BLCR's
         configure script will require either '<tt>--with-bug2524</tt>' or
         '<tt>--without-bug2524</tt>'.  If you are uncertain, configure using
         '<tt>--with-bug2524</tt>', which is always safe.  If you make an incorrect
         choice at configure time, then when you run '<tt>make check</tt>' the
         test '<tt>bug2524</tt>' will let you know.<br></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ARM<br>
    <ul>
    <li> Kernel versions 2.6.11 and older lack true atomic compare-and-swap
         support, which BLCR require.  Therefore, one must
         use a 2.6.12 kernel or later on ARM plarforms.</li>
