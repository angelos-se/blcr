<h1>Berkeley Lab Checkpoint/Restart (BLCR) User's Guide</h1>
<p>This guide describes how to use Berkeley Lab Checkpoint/Restart (BLCR) for Linux.
For information on installation, configuration, and maintenance of BLCR, please
see the companion <a href="BLCR_Admin_Guide.html">BLCR Administrator's Guide</a>.
<h2>1. About Berkeley Lab Checkpoint/Restart</h2>
Checkpoint/Restart allows you to save one or more processes to a file
and later
restart them from that file. There are three main uses for this:
<ol>
  <li><b>Scheduling</b>: Checkpointing a program allows a program to be
safely stopped at any point in its execution, so that some other
program can run in its place. The original program can then be run
again later.</li>
  <li><b>Process Migration</b>: If a compute node appears to be likely
to crash, or there is some other reason for shutting it down (routine
maintenance, hardware upgrade, etc.), checkpoint/restart allows any
processes running on it to be moved to a different node (or saved until
the original node is available again).</li>
  <li><b>Failure recovery</b>: A long running program can be
checkpointed periodically, so that if it crashes due to hardware,
system software, or some other non-deterministic cause, it can be
restarted from a point in its execution more recent that starting from
the beginning.</li>
</ol>
Berkeley Lab Checkpoint/Restart (BLCR) provides checkpoint/restart on
Linux
systems. BLCR can be used either with processes on a single computer,
or
on parallel jobs (such as <a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/">MPI</a>
applications) which may be running across multiple machines on a
cluster of
Linux nodes.
<blockquote>
Note: Checkpointing parallel jobs requires a library
which has integrated BLCR support. At the present time, many MPI
implementations are known to support checkpoint/restart with BLCR.
Consult the corresponding BLCR FAQ <a href="FAQ.html#mpi">entry</a>
for the current list.
</blockquote>
<h2>2. Checkpoint/restarting within a BLCR-aware batch control system</h2>
One way to use BLCR is with a batch scheduler system (a.k.a. "job
controller",
"queue manager", etc.) that knows how to use the BLCR tools to
checkpoint and
restart the jobs under its control. You can simply tell such a system
to
"suspend" or "checkpoint" a job, and then later to "resume" or
"restart" it.
<p>BLCR has been integrated with several batch systems, to differing
degrees.  Please see the
corresponding BLCR FAQ <a href="FAQ.html#batch">entry</a> for the
current list.
</p>
<p>The rest of this document assumes that your batch scheduler does <b>not</b>
have built-in support for BLCR. In this case you will manually run the
BLCR
commands needed to checkpoint/restart your jobs.</p>
<blockquote><i> Note: this does not mean that you cannot
checkpoint/restart your applications if you use a batch system without
built-in support for BLCR. It simply means that you have to do your
checkpoints/restarts manually as described in the remainder of this
document. To the batch system, a job that is
checkpointed and terminated manually simply looks like a job that has
"completed". A restart of an application looks like a "new" job.</i></blockquote>
<h2>3. Checkpointing Jobs with the BLCR command-line tools</h2>
<h3>3.1 Make sure BLCR is installed and loaded</h3>
<p>This guide assumes that BLCR has already been successfully built,
installed,
and configured on your system (presumably by you or your system
administrator).
One easy way to test this is to use the '<tt>lsmod</tt>' command to see
if the
BLCR kernel module is loaded on the node(s) that your program will run
on:</p> <pre>
    % /sbin/lsmod | grep blcr
    blcr                   47508   0
    blcr_imports            7808   1 blcr
</pre>
If you don't see these two modules in the output of
'<tt>lsmod</tt>', then BLCR is <b>not</b> yet running on your system.
Consult the <a href="BLCR_Admin_Guide.html">BLCR Administrators Guide</a>
for instructions on
building and installing BLCR.
<h3>3.2 Make sure your environment is set up correctly</h3>
You must ensure that the BLCR commands, libraries and manual pages can
be found
in your shell.
<p>Try running</p><pre>
    % cr_checkpoint --help
</pre>
If '<tt>cr_checkpoint</tt>' cannot be found, you need to modify your '<tt>PATH</tt>'
to
include the directory where '<tt>cr_checkpoint</tt>' lives. You will
probably
also want to modify your '<tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>' variable to contain
the
directory where '<tt>libcr.so</tt>' lives, and add the BLCR man
directory to
your '<tt>MANPATH</tt>'.
<h4>Setting up your environment with 'modules'</h4>
<p> If your system uses the <a href="http://modules.sourceforge.net/">Environment
Modules</a> system to manage software
packages, you may be able to get all of your needed environment
settings simply
by entering something like
</p>
<pre>    % module add blcr<br></pre>
However, there is no requirement that 'blcr' is the name of the module
you'll
need; your administrator may have given it a different name
('checkpoint',
etc.). Or s/he may have neglected to add BLCR to the set of packages
managed by
modules, in which case you'll need to use the 'manual' technique
below.
<h4>Manually setting up your environment</h4>
<p>Note that this is generally only required if your system administrator has
neither installed BLCR in a well-known location nor modified the system-wide
defaults for environment variables.  However, if your shell startup files
override the system-wide defaults, this step may still be necessary.</p>
<p>To manually set up your environment for BLCR, the first thing you
need to
know is where it has been installed. By default, BLCR installs into the
'<tt>/usr/local</tt>' directory tree, but your system administrator may
have put
it elsewhere by passing '<tt>--prefix=<i>PREFIX</i></tt>' when BLCR was
built
(where <i>PREFIX</i> can be any arbitrary directory). See your system
documents, or try commands such as '<tt>locate cr_checkpoint</tt>' or
'<tt>find</tt>'.
</p>
<p>Once you have determined where BLCR is installed, enter the
following
commands (depending on which type of shell you are using), replacing
<tt>PREFIX</tt> with the value specified for the '<tt>--prefix</tt>'
option used when configuring BLCR.
</p>
<p>To configure a bourne-type shell (such as '<tt>bash</tt>' or '<tt>ksh</tt>'):
</p><pre>
    $ PATH=$PATH:<i>PREFIX</i>/bin
    $ MANPATH=$MANPATH:<i>PREFIX</i>/man
    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<i>PREFIX</i>/lib:<i>PREFIX</i>/lib64
    $ export PATH MANPATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>
<p>
To configure a csh-type shell (such as '<tt>csh</tt>' or '<tt>tcsh</tt>'):
</p><pre>
    % setenv PATH ${PATH}:<i>PREFIX</i>/bin
    % setenv MANPATH ${MANPATH}:<i>PREFIX</i>/man
    % setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:<i>PREFIX</i>/lib:<i>PREFIX</i>/lib64
</pre>
<p>These example assume a "multilib" system with both <tt>/lib</tt> and <tt>/lib64</tt>
directories.  If your system lacks one of these two directories, the corresponding
colon-separated entry may be omitted from the value of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
<p>
The above examples set the PATH, MANPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables
in your
<i>current</i> shell only. It is strongly recommended that you make these
settings permanent, to make these settings affect future sessions or
windows. To do this, you must add the example commands to your shell's
start up files.
For a single user of BLCR, you should add the appropriate set of
commands to the
shell startup files in your home directory ('<tt>.bashrc</tt>' for
bash, '<tt>.profile</tt>' for other bourne-type shells, or
'<tt>.cshrc</tt>' for csh-type shells). For a system-wide
installation, add the bourne shell commands
to '<tt>/etc/bashrc</tt>' and '<tt>/etc/profile</tt>' and the csh
commands to '<tt>/etc/cshrc</tt>'.
</p>
<h2>4. Checkpointing/restarting applications on a single machine</h2>
<h3>4.1Types of applications supported</h3>
BLCR currently supports:
<ul>
  <li> Single threaded applications</li>
  <li> Multithreaded applications using the NPTL implementation
of pthreads (NOTE: BLCR 0.7.0 dropped support
for the older LinuxThreads implementation)</li>
  <li>Process trees, meaning a process and all its "reachable"
descendants (excluding those who's parent has exited)</li>
  <li>Process groups (as defined by POSIX), which typically means a
command pipeline launched by a shell (e.g. "cat foo bar | sort")</li>
  <li>POSIX sessions, which typically means a login shell and all its
descendants or a batch job</li>
</ul>
However, certain applications are not supported because they use
resources not restored by BLCR:
<ul>
  <li> Applications which use sockets (regardless of address family).
If a checkpoint is taken of a process with open sockets, they will not
be restored when the process is restarted.&nbsp; Applications or
libraries may register a checkpoint callback to manage socket
connections to re-open them at restart time (this is how MPI libraries
typically work with BLCR), but the core BLCR checkpointer does not
directly support restoring sockets.
In releases prior to 0.5.0 would fail at checkpoint time if sockets
were open.</li>
 <li> Applications which use character or block devices (e.g. serial
ports or raw partitions).&nbsp; At restart time any devices will
appear to have been closed.&nbsp; As with sockets, code that
is BLCR-aware may choose to take its own measures to deal with
devices.</li>
  <li>Applications which use SystemV IPC mechanisms including shared
memory, semaphores and message queues.&nbsp; As with sockets, code that
is BLCR-aware may choose to take its own measures to deal with these
resources.</li>
  <li>Others - this list is not exhaustive.&nbsp; If you have questions
about specific resources, see the section "<a
 href="#For_more_information">For more information</a>" for contact
information.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="making_checkpointable">4.2 Making an application checkpointable</a></h3>
To be checkpointed successfully with BLCR, an application must contain
some
library code that BLCR provides. There are several ways of ensuring
this.  <b>Note:</b> in the examples that follow we will use "<i>BLCR_LIBDIR</i>"
to denote the directory where the BLCR appropriate libraries are installed.
If <i>PREFIX</i> is the root of your BLCR install, then this will typically be
either "<tt>PREFIX/lib</tt>" or "<tt>PREFIX/lib64</tt>" depending on various
conditions.
<ol>
  <li> Start your executable via the with the '<tt>cr_run</tt>'
command:
    <pre>        % cr_run <i>your_executable [arguments]</i><br></pre>
'<tt>cr_run</tt>' loads the BLCR library into your application at
startup time. You do not need to modify an application to have it work
with '<tt>cr_run</tt>'.&nbsp; However, '<tt>cr_run</tt>' is limited to
dynamically linked executables; statically linked executables will need
to use one of the approaches listed below.</li>

  <li> Link your application with BLCR's '<tt>libcr_run</tt>'. For
instance, you could make a simple 'hello world' C program
checkpointable via
    <pre>        % gcc -o hello hello.c -L<i>BLCR_LIBDIR</i> -lcr_run -u cr_run_link_me<br></pre>
Your application
will now look for the BLCR library whenever it starts up, but note that
this does not mean it will automatically be found: you may also need
to set your '<tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>' environment variable as described earlier (or
read the '<tt>ld</tt>' man page for information on '<tt>-rpath</tt>').
If using this approach, please read the "Cautionary linker notes", below.</li>

  <li> Link your application with BLCR's '<tt>libcr</tt>'. While linking
<tt>libcr_run</tt> (see above) works for simple 'hello world' applications,
it doesn't allow the application any sort of control over what gets checkpointed.
To get such control, link to '<tt>libcr</tt>' with a command such as
    <pre>        % gcc -o my_app my_app.c -L<i>BLCR_LIBDIR</i> -lcr<br></pre>
As with the
<tt>libcr_run</tt> example above, you may need to ensure correct settings in
you environment to allow the library to be
found when the application starts.
Note that '<tt>-ldl</tt>' and '<tt>-lpthread</tt>' might also be required
to satisfy dependencies in <tt>libcr</tt>.</li>

  <li> Link your application with some library which uses BLCR. For
instance, if your MPI library has been made BLCR-aware, it will cause
<tt>libcr</tt> to be loaded, and so simply linking with <tt>mpicc</tt> is
enough to make your application checkpointable.</li>

  <li>Use run-time loading to dynamically link '<tt>libcr</tt>'
or '<tt>libcr_run</tt>'
(see the '<tt>dlopen</tt>' man page).&nbsp; This mechanism can be
used for building applications or libraries that must work both with
and without BLCR present on a system.</li>

  <li>Force the '<tt>libcr_run.so</tt>' dynamic library to do loaded at
startup by adding it's full pathname to the '<tt>LD_PRELOAD</tt>'
environment variable (or just the filename if the directory is listed
in '<tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>').
We do <b>not</b> recommend setting this in your environment
in general (via '<tt>export</tt>' or '<tt>setenv</tt>'), since
certain programs may interact poorly with the BLCR library
logic. Instead, we recommend that you use a command like
    <pre>        % env LD_PRELOAD=<i>BLCR_LIBDIR</i>/libcr_run.so.0 <i>your_executable [arguments ]</i><br></pre>
This is essentially how '<tt>cr_run</tt>' works.</li>

  <li> Finally there exists the option to link an application in
such a way that it will simply disappear from a checkpoint.
While this case may sound odd, there are actual instances of "helper"
processes that can be omitted from a multi-process checkpoint and
re-fork()ed when restarting.  For this purpose, one can link
<tt>libcr_omit</tt>.  The link command is identical to that for
<tt>libcr_run</tt>, changing the two instances of "run" to "omit":
    <pre>        % gcc -o goodbye goodbye.c -L<i>BLCR_LIBDIR</i> -lcr_omit -u cr_omit_link_me<br></pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If you your application does not link in BLCR's library via one of
the mechanisms listed above, then any attempt to checkpoint it will
fail gracefully&nbsp; In
BLCR releases prior to 0.5.0 this situation would
cause the program to die unless you handled BLCR's real-time signal
explicitly.</p>

<h4>Cautionary linker notes</h4>
The ELF linker for Linux will normally include ELF DT_NEEDED tags for all
dynamic libraries given on the link command line.  However, one can pass the
<tt>--as-needed</tt> linker option to generate such tags only for those
libraries that supply some symbol referenced elsewhere.  However, the intended
use of <tt>libcr_run</tt> and <tt>libcr_omit</tt> is linking with executables
that have <i>not</i> been modified to reference any BLCR symbols.  It is for
this reason that the instructions above contain "<tt>-u cr_run_link_me</tt>"
and "<tt>-u cr_omit_link_me</tt>".   These each serve to artificially create
an undefined reference to a symbol which we've supplied in the BLCR libraries
for exactly this purpose, thus ensuring the appropriate BLCR library is linked.

<p>BLCR does not currently build static libraries (e.g. <tt>libcr.a</tt>) by default.
However, if your installation was configured to do so, then a link command that
includes <tt>-static</tt> will encounter the same problem detailed above
for the <tt>--as-needed</tt> linker flag (and for the same reason: libraries
are not linked unless they satisfy an undefined symbol reference.)  Since the
problem is the same, it should come as no surprise that the solution is too:
pass the appropriate "<tt>-u</tt> <i>symbol</i>" linker flags.  If your
installation has gone so far as to install only static libraries (not shared),
then you will face this problem even without the <tt>-static</tt> flag.

<p>As a result of the issues above, we strongly recommend that authors of Makefiles
that link <tt>libcr_run</tt> or <tt>libcr_omit</tt> uniformly use
"<tt>-lcr_run -u cr_run_link_me</tt>" and <tt>-lcr_omit -u cr_omit_link_me</tt>".
This will guard against the possibility of user-provided LDFLAGS (or equivalent)
that could trigger (silently) the omission of the desired BLCR library from the
generated executable.

<p>While one would not normally link <tt>libcr</tt> without referencing any functions
in it, <tt>libcr</tt> does provide the symbol <tt>cr_link_me</tt> for completeness.

<p>Finally, note that the symbol you specify after <tt>-u</tt> is also a good
way to check that you've linked in BLCR.  Assuming you've not stripped your
executable, the following command should find the symbol:
    <pre>        % nm my_app | grep _link_me<br></pre>
If you don't see any output then you've probably not linked in BLCR's library.
Recheck your link command, especially the value you used for <tt>BLCR_LIBDIR</tt>,

<h3>4.3 Checkpointing the process</h3>
To checkpoint a process, simply run
<pre>    % cr_checkpoint <i>PID</i><br></pre>
where <i>PID</i> is the application's process ID.
<p>By default, '<tt>cr_checkpoint</tt>' saves a checkpoint, and then
lets your
application continue running, which is useful for saving
the state of a
process in case
it later fails.&nbsp; However, you may terminate the
process after it has been checkpointed by passing
the
'<tt>--term</tt>' flag:
</p>
<pre>    % cr_checkpoint --term <i>PID</i><br></pre>
This causes a '<tt>SIGTERM</tt>' signal to be sent to the process at
the end
of the checkpoint. To send a different signal to
your
process at the end of the checkpoint, you can pass any arbitrary signal
number
using the '<tt>--signal=</tt><i>N</i>' flag or one of the related
arguments documented in the manpage for <tt>cr_checkpoint</tt>.
<p>By default BLCR interprets the final argument (<i>PID</i> in the
examples above) as the process id of a (potentially multi-threaded) process to
checkpoint, along with all of its children (and their children, etc.).&nbsp;
However, there are options to request a checkpoint of a different <em>scope</em>
for the checkpoint:
</p>
<pre>    % cr_checkpoint --pgid <i>PGID</i><br>    % cr_checkpoint --sid <i>SID</i><br>    % cr_checkpoint --tree <i>PID</i><br>    % cr_checkpoint --pid <i>PID</i><br></pre>
These four examples request, respectively, checkpoints over the scope of a process
group, a session, a process tree (the default), and a single process.&nbsp; The <i>PGID</i>
is a process group identifier and <i>SID</i> is a session
identifier. Here we take the terms "process
group" and "session" to mean the set of processes having the given pgid
or sid.&nbsp; In most cases the
pgid
or sid is just the pid of the process group leader or session leader.
When in
doubt, try using the '<tt>-j</tt>' option to '<tt>ps</tt>' to
show
PGID and
SID columns.
The '<tt>--tree</tt>' flag to '<tt>cr_checkpoint</tt>' requests
a
checkpoint of the process with the given pid, and all its descendants
(excluding those who's parent has exited and thus become children of
the
'<tt>init</tt>' process). This is the same as the grouping shown
by the output of the '<tt>pstree</tt>' command.
<br>In BLCR releases prior to 0.6.0 the --pid option was the default.
<p>When checkpointing multiple processes using one of the scope
arguments other then <tt>--pid</tt>,
all the pipes among the processes are saved and
restored. Pipes to/from processes not within the checkpoint scope are
not
saved (these will be replaced at restart time by the stdin or stdout
of the '<tt>cr_restart</tt>' process).</p>
<p>While '<tt>cr_checkpoint</tt>' will accept a process
group or session identifier as a scope argument, BLCR does not
currently restore the pgid or sid of restarted processes.&nbsp; Instead
restored processes inherit the pgid and sid of the '<tt>cr_restart</tt>'
process.&nbsp; This is considered a sane default because an unmodified
parent (such as a shell) of '<tt>cr_restart</tt>' would lose job
control over the processes if these identifiers are restored.&nbsp; A
future BLCR release will include the ability to request restore of
these identifiers.</p>
<p>Files that contain checkpoints are called <em>context files</em>.
By
default, they are named '<tt>context.<i>ID</i></tt>', where <i>ID</i>
is the
pid, pgid or sid that was checkpointed, and are stored in the current
working
directory of the '<tt>cr_checkpoint</tt>' process. You may specify an
alternate name and location of the context file via the '<tt>--file</tt>'
option.
</p>
<p>There are a number of other options that '<tt>cr_checkpoint</tt>'
provides. See
the man page (or '<tt>cr_checkpoint --help</tt>') for details.
</p>
<h3>4.4 Restarting the process</h3>
<p>To successfully restart from a context file, certain conditions must be
met:
<ul>
  <li> The PIDs of processes in the context file must not be in use, <em>OR</em> you
may specify <tt>--no-restore-pid</tt> to obtain new pids (but see the <tt>cr_restart</tt> man
page for limitations of this approach).</li>
  <li> The original executable must be available: either it must exist with its contents 
unchanged, <em>OR</em> you may specify any of
of the options <tt>--save-exe</tt>, <tt>--save-private</tt> or
<tt>--save-all</tt> to <tt>cr_checkpoint</tt> to include the executable
in the context file.
</li>
  <li> All shared libraries used by the executable must be available: either they must exist with
their contents unchanged, <em>OR</em> you may specify either of
of the options <tt>--save-private</tt> or
<tt>--save-all</tt> to <tt>cr_checkpoint</tt> to include the shared libraries
in the context file.
</li>
  <li>Because BLCR saves and restore most open files "by reference"
(storing pathnames rather than file contents), the following should be
true of files that were open() or mmap()ed
when the checkpoint was taken, though certain applications may be more
tolerant than these rules imply:
    <ul>
      <li> Files must exist at their original paths, <em>OR</em>
you may use the <tt>--relocate</tt> option to <tt>cr_restart</tt> to
specify alternative location(s) for files.  It is
permissible to use a copy of the original file (for instance
when
performing migration).</li>
      <li> File and directories must have
permissions that
permit them to be opened for the original access modes.</li>
      <li> Files open for reading should not be modified relative to
their contents
when the checkpoint was taken in any way observable by the application.</li>
      <li> Files that are open for writing which are written in an
append-only
manner (regardless of the O_APPEND flag) may have data appended after
the
checkpoint was taken. Such data will be truncated away when the
application
is restarted.</li>
      <li>Files that are open for both reading and writing should be
restored
to exactly their state at the time of the checkpoint.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An exception to the open/mmaped files rules above exists for files
already unlinked (deleted) at the time the checkpoint is taken.  When BLCR
encounters such a file, its entire contents is saved in the checkpoint
context file and is later restored as a new (also unlinked) file.</li>
  <li>You may specify
<tt>--save-all</tt> to <tt>cr_checkpoint</tt> to include all mmap()ed file
in the context file and thus eliminate the requirements above with respect
to mmap()ed files <i>only</i> -- this option does not do anything for
files that have been open()ed.</li>
</ul>
Of these requirements, BLCR is only able to verify the availability of
the PIDs and the existence and permissions of the executable, libraries
and open files.&nbsp; Failure to satisfy those constraints will lead
to an explicit failure from BLCR.&nbsp; Violation of the rules against
modification to any files will <b>not</b> be
detected by BLCR and the resulting effects on the restarted application
are unpredictable.
<p>You may restart a program on a different machine than the one it was
checkpointed on if all of these conditions are met (they often are on
cluster systems, especially if you are using a shared network
filesystem), and the kernels are the same.&nbsp; The restriction on
executables and their shared
libraries being the same can be a problem for systems using <em>prelinking</em>;
see the <a href="FAQ.html">BLCR FAQ</a> for information on dealing
with systems that prelink.</p>
<p>You can restart a process by using '<tt>cr_restart</tt>' on its
context file:
<pre>    % cr_restart context.15005<br></pre>
The original process will be restored, and resume running in the exact
state it
was in at checkpoint time. Note that this includes restoring its
process ID, so
you cannot restart a program unless the original copy of it has exited
(otherwise '<tt>cr_restart</tt>' will fail with a message that the PID
is
already in use).
You may restart a process from a particular context file as many
times as you
wish. The context file is not automatically removed at any point, so
you
should delete it if/when it is no longer useful to you.
